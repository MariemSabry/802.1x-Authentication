# Security Using 802.1X Port-Based Authentication
The IEEE 802.1X standard defines a port-based access control and authentication protocol that restricts 
unauthorized workstations from connecting to a LAN through publicly accessible switch ports. The 
authentication server authenticates each workstation that is connected to a switch port before making available 
any services offered by the switch or the LAN.


The 802.1x roles include:
• Supplicant (Client) .

• Authenticator (Switch)

• Authentication server
